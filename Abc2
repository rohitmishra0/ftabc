. Architecture Solution Design
Frontend (Angular):

UI components for Home, Login, Signup, Course View, Profile, XP Purchase

Communicates with backend via REST APIs

Hosted on GitHub Pages

Backend (Spring Boot):

RESTful APIs for user actions

Handles XP logic, course management, payments

Hosted on Render/Railway/AWS/GCP

Database (Appwrite):

Auth module: handles user login/signup

Collections: users, courses, enrollments, payments, transactions, skills

Payment Gateway:

Razorpay or Stripe for handling XP purchases

Integrated into Spring Boot backend

Architecture Diagram (Conceptual):

[Frontend (Angular)]  <--->  [Backend (Spring Boot)]  <--->  [Appwrite DB]
          |                              |
          |                              v
          +-----> Payment Gateway <------+
5. Security Requirements
Authentication: JWT-based login using Appwrite Auth or Google OAuth

Authorization: Role-based API access (only creators can post courses, only logged-in users can enroll)

Input Validation: On both frontend (Angular forms) and backend (Spring validators)

Secure Communication: HTTPS enforced on all endpoints

Data Protection: Passwords hashed; sensitive operations secured

Payment Safety: Webhooks validated with HMAC signatures (Razorpay/Stripe)

6. Extra Functionality for the Solution
XP Transaction History: Users can view detailed logs of where XP was spent/earned

Course Recommendations: Show “Courses You May Like” based on enrollments

Notifications: Email confirmations for XP purchases and enrollments

Referral System (Future): Earn XP for referring new users

7. Reporting
Admin Reports (future scope):

Total number of users

Most popular categories/courses

XP purchased vs. XP spent statistics

User Reports:

XP usage history

Course engagement metrics

Payment receipt history (via email & dashboard)

8. Integration
Appwrite: User authentication, DB storage, and file hosting (course videos, thumbnails)

Payment Gateway (Razorpay/Stripe): Integrated into Spring Boot backend for XP purchases

Email Service: SendGrid or Appwrite built-in email to notify users post purchase/enrollment

9. Data Migration
Initial data: Skills/categories (IT, Music, Language...) manually seeded in Appwrite

Future migration:

Export/import JSON schema from Appwrite console

Write migration scripts if migrating to SQL in future

Backup policies using Appwrite’s export features

Break the architecture design into high level and low level design

Here’s how we can break down the Architecture Solution Design of your Bartr – Skill Barter System into High-Level Design (HLD) and Low-Level Design (LLD):

High-Level Design (HLD)
Objective: Provide a macro view of the system, its components, and interactions.

1. System Overview
Bartr is a skill exchange platform where XP acts as a virtual credit. Users can create and enroll in courses by spending or earning XP.

2. Component Overview
Component	Technology	Responsibility
Frontend	Angular	UI rendering, routing, form validations, UX
Backend	Spring Boot	Business logic, REST API, XP logic, payment handling
Database	Appwrite DB	Storage of users, courses, skills, transactions
Authentication	Appwrite Auth	User login/signup, session management
Payment Gateway	Razorpay/Stripe	XP purchase via INR payments
Deployment	GitHub Pages (frontend) + Render/Heroku (backend)	Hosting

  |   Appwrite DB    |              |  Razorpay / Stripe   |
  +------------------+              +---------------------+
Low-Level Design (LLD)
Objective: Break down individual modules, endpoints, logic, and data flow.

1. Frontend (Angular)
Modules:

auth: login, signup, password reset

dashboard: user profile, enrolled/created courses

course: course list, detail, creation

xp: purchase XP form

Routing:

/login, /signup, /courses, /profile, /purchase-xp

Services:

CourseService: fetch, create, enroll courses

UserService: profile, XP balance

PaymentService: initiate XP purchase

2. Backend (Spring Boot)
Controllers (REST Endpoints):

Controller	Endpoint	Method	Purpose
AuthController	/api/auth/login	POST	Login and return JWT
/api/auth/register	POST	Signup using Appwrite
UserController	/api/user/profile	GET	Get user info
/api/user/xp	GET	Get XP balance
CourseController	/api/courses	GET	List all courses
/api/courses	POST	Create a course
/api/courses/enroll	POST	Enroll in a course
XPController	/api/xp/purchase	POST	Initiate XP purchase
PaymentWebhook	/api/payment/webhook	POST	Handle Razorpay callback

Service Layer (Business Logic):

XpService: XP deduction, transfer, refund

CourseService: category XP cost mapping, validation

PaymentService: order verification, XP top-up

EnrollmentService: handles course access logic

Model Layer:

User, Course, Enrollment, Transaction, Payment, Skill

3. Appwrite (Database & Auth)
Collections:

users: id, email, xp, avatar, phone

courses: id, title, description, skill_id, xp_cost, creator_id

skills: id, name, xp_cost

enrollments: learner_id, course_id, date

payments: user_id, amount, xp_purchased, mode

transactions: user_id, course_id, amount, type (XP_SPENT, XP_GAINED)

Authentication:

Appwrite OAuth and JWT tokens

Password encryption & email confirmation

4. Payment Integration (Stripe / Razorpay)
Frontend:

Collect XP purchase intent

Show total price (XP × ₹5)

Trigger payment modal from Razorpay SDK

Backend:

On successful payment:

Validate payment via webhook

Update XP in users table

Log transaction in payments and transactions

5. XP Transaction Logic (Core)
java
Copy code
public boolean enrollCourse(int courseId, int learnerId) {
    int xpRequired = getCourseXP(courseId);
    int learnerXP = getUserXP(learnerId);

    if (learnerXP < xpRequired) return false;

    deductXP(learnerId, xpRequired);
    addXP(getCourseCreator(courseId), xpRequired);
    createEnrollment(courseId, learnerId);
    logTransaction(learnerId, courseId, xpRequired, "XP_SPENT");
    logTransaction(creatorId, courseId, xpRequired, "XP_GAINED");
    return true;
}
