üìÑ Feasibility Study Report
Project Title: Testing of PortfolioPro Web Application
Prepared By: Mahendra Singh
Date: [Insert Date]
Tools Used: Java, Selenium, TestNG, Eclipse IDE

1. Project Overview
PortfolioPro is a responsive web application designed to help users create, manage, and share digital portfolios. The main modules tested include:

Portfolio Creation Wizard (Basic Info, Contact, Content, Image, Theme)

Portfolio Page (final display, Edit, Copy Link, Share functionalities)

Before entering the structured testing phase, one full end-to-end automated sanity test was conducted covering critical workflows. This passed successfully and served as the gate for comprehensive manual and automated testing of 48 detailed test cases.

2. Purpose of the Feasibility Study
This feasibility study assesses the viability and effectiveness of the QA testing project for PortfolioPro. It evaluates:

Test coverage adequacy

Technical tool alignment (Java + Selenium + TestNG)

Automation strategy scalability

Overall test process integration within the Agile SDLC

3. Scope of Testing
‚úÖ In-Scope:
Functional testing of Portfolio Creation and Portfolio Page modules

UI & UX validation

Regression & integration testing

Automation testing for high-priority regression flows

‚ùå Out-of-Scope:
Backend database validation (direct queries)

Load/stress/performance testing

Multi-language (i18n/l10n) testing

External integrations

4. Test Automation Framework Overview
You designed a robust framework using:

Component	Details
Language	Java
Framework	Selenium WebDriver + TestNG
IDE	Eclipse
Test Reports	TestNG-generated HTML/XML reports
Design	Modular Page Object Model (POM) architecture
Execution	Local parallel execution (with scope for CI/CD later)

The test suite includes:

Dynamic locators for form fields and buttons

Assertion checks for input validations and theme previews

Utility classes for browser handling, screenshots, and reusable waits

5. Test Execution Summary
‚úÖ 48 test cases executed successfully (functional + regression)

üö´ Defects Identified: [List count from defect tracker]

üß™ Automation Coverage: ~70% for stable regression workflows

6. Resource Feasibility
Aspect	Feasibility Comment
Tools & IDE	Java, Selenium, TestNG, Eclipse‚Äîall open and stable
Environment	Web-based, cross-browser tested on Chrome & Edge
Test Data	Dummy data used; reset after each execution cycle
Test Management	Excel sheets with traceability matrix included

7. Risk Analysis
Risk	Mitigation
Changes in PortfolioPro FRD mid-sprint	Agile communication with BA & dev
Theme rendering delays or bugs	Regression test cycle before release
Manual testing fatigue	Automated suite maintained for regression
Environment inconsistencies	Dedicated test environment ensured

8. Feasibility Conclusion
Given the maturity of the automation framework, successful initial end-to-end test execution, and availability of the required tools, the PortfolioPro testing project is highly feasible. The testing strategy efficiently validates critical user flows, ensures quality, and supports future scalability for CI/CD and performance testing integration.

This initiative demonstrates solid alignment with agile best practices, and the automated framework provides long-term value through maintainability and reusability.
