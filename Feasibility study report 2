📄 Feasibility Study Report
Project Title: Testing of PortfolioPro Web Application
Prepared By: Mahendra Singh
Tools Used: Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Eclipse IDE
Date: [Insert Date]

1. Project Overview
PortfolioPro is a web-based digital portfolio builder that helps users create, personalize, and share professional portfolios. The application includes:

Portfolio Creation Wizard (Basic Info → Contact → Content → Image → Theme)

Portfolio Page (Final view with edit, copy, and share capabilities)

Before manual and regression testing, a complete end-to-end automation test was conducted using Java + Selenium + TestNG via Eclipse IDE. The successful pass of this test allowed the team to proceed with full-scale test execution of 48 detailed cases.

2. Purpose of the Feasibility Study
The aim of this feasibility report is to evaluate the readiness and practicality of conducting structured testing for the PortfolioPro project. It assesses:

Technical compatibility of the tools and frameworks

Resource and data availability

Risk areas and mitigation strategies

Automation framework scalability and usefulness

3. Scope of Testing
✅ In-Scope:
Functional Testing (all form pages and Portfolio Page)

Input validations, navigation, image uploads, and theme selection

Regression Testing of critical flows

UI & UX consistency

Data rendering and integrity checks

❌ Out-of-Scope:
Load or performance testing

Multi-language (i18n/l10n) validation

Direct backend DB validations

3rd-party integrations and SSO

4. Framework & Tools Used
You implemented a robust automation setup using:

Component	Details
Language	Java
Automation	Selenium WebDriver
Testing	TestNG Framework
IDE	Eclipse
Execution	Local environment
Framework	Page Object Model (POM)
Reporting	TestNG HTML/XML reports

✅ Features included:

Dynamic locators

Page-wise modular scripts

Screenshot capture on failures

Assertion validations for fields, transitions, and theme previews

5. Testing Summary
✅ 48 test cases executed

✅ Covered all critical modules and edge cases

🔁 Manual + Automation blended execution

📋 RTM and Defect Logs prepared

🔧 Bugs resolved during early regression

🚀 Result: High confidence for release

6. Resources & Environments
Parameter	Feasibility Verdict
Tooling	Java, Selenium, Eclipse all stable and supported
Test Data	Dummy data sets reset for each cycle
Environments	Chrome, Edge tested for UI compatibility
Test Planning Artifacts	Test Plan, Test Scenarios, RTM, and Reports ready

7. Risk Assessment
Risk Area	Mitigation Strategy
UI layout inconsistencies	Manual validation + snapshot assertions
FRD changes during sprint	Agile syncs with BAs and dev team
Delayed test data availability	Used mock data and refresh scripts
Unstable builds	Smoke test before full execution

8. Conclusion
The end-to-end test success followed by detailed execution of 48 test cases confirms that the PortfolioPro testing effort is highly feasible. The use of Java + Selenium + TestNG ensures scalable automation and structured validations.

This process proves not only the application’s readiness but also the testing team’s preparedness to handle both functional and future CI/CD-integrated pipelines. All artifacts like RTM, Defect Logs, and Summary Reports are in place, supporting the conclusion of a successful and practical testing implementation.
